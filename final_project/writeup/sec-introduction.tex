Finding the optimal Binary Search Tree (BST) is a somewhat classical programming problem. Given a list of keys and a probability that each key will be looked up i.e. frequency, the optimal binary search tree minimizes the expected search time over all keys. Figure~\ref{fig:opt-bst} shows 5 different BSTs that can be constructed given a set of keys (value row). The cost (search time) of a tree is the summation of $frequency \times depth + 1$ of every node.

A solution to the optimal BST problem is to simply try each key as root and recursively build each subtree. After exhaustively constructing every valid BST structure, the one with the minimum cost can be chosen. Given a tree with $n$ nodes, this would take exponential time to solve. However, this naive solution can be further improved to $O(n^3)$ with dynamic programming. Although finding the optimal BST structure for any arbitrary set of keys and frequencies has been bounded, we would like to explore the application of an evolutionary algorithm to this problem.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

Given a set of keys $k_1,k_2,\dots,k_n$ and a set of frequencies $f_1,f_2,\dots,f_n$ such that $f_i$ is the expected search frequency of $k_i$, we would like to use an evolutionary algorithm to construct a BST with minimal expected search time over all keys given the frequencies.
