\section{Code}

To avoid having code within this report, all code used for this project can be found on my GitHub in a public repository~\cite{project_repository}. \texttt{BST.py} contains a class \texttt{BST}. All methods related to my genome representation are implemented within that class. \texttt{main.py} is a driver and runs the genetic algorithm. Within \texttt{main.py}, we first define some hyper-parameters: \texttt{TREE\_SIZE=50, POP\_SIZE=45, GENERATIONS=500, SELECT\_PERC=0.3}. The agents are then initialized and evolved within the \texttt{ga()} function.

\subsection{Search Space Representation}

 \texttt{BST} has an attribute called \texttt{nodes}, which represents the order in which each node was inserted to construct the BST. The constructor: \texttt{\_\_init\_\_(self, data)} takes a list of pairs of keys and frequencies, creates a node for each pair, and inserts each node into the BST.

 \subsection{Variation Operator Encoding}
Crossover is implemented as a static method: \texttt{crossover(p1, p2)}. Given two parents, it produces a single child by the crossover process described in Section~\ref{sec-algorithm}.

 \subsection{Selection Operator Encoding}
Selection is done in \texttt{main.py}. All agents are sorted by fitness, and the top 30\% are selected to move on to the next generation.

 \subsection{Termination Criterion}
We only terminate when the optimal cost is reached. The actual optimal cost is calculated beforehand using a proven classical approach. However, the optimal is usually never found given the hyper-parameters.
