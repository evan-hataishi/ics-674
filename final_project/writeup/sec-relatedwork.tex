The question of constructing optimal BSTs is a well-known problem with well-known classical and dynamic programming solutions as briefly discussed in Section~\ref{sec-introduction}. For this reason (we assume), we find only two significant works that propose evolutionary approaches to the question. The work in~\cite{zamanifar2007designing} proposed an evolutionary algorithm, but the main focus is on parallelization of the algorithm rather than the algorithm itself. The work in~\cite{fatemi2007new} also proposes an evolutionary algorithm to efficiently produce near-optimal BSTs. The maid ideo of this work is the way in which crossover is implemented by directly merging the structure of two BSTs.
